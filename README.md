# parasitism

A thing I made before GANs even were a thing, around 2012.

In essense, this is a toy model of a phenomenological evolutionary emergence of advanced & persistent threats, also known as the nest hypothesis.

A set of obligate parasites enters in an evolutionary arms race with a set of possible hosts.

These two sets are against each other, as they hone their ability to identify and imprint on artifacts of the environment.

Each parasite, if it passes the filters of the hosts, converges unknowingly to a very small subset of kind of hosts that can only be identified by the uniqueness of their secondary phenotypic characterists -- or their extended phenotype.

The fact that this happens in Nature is simply extraordinary.
